# 🎧 My Top 5 Playlist

This is my first HTML-only project, created through self-learning.  
It displays my top 5 favorite songs using basic HTML elements like:

- Song title (with headings)
- Artist name
- Song images
- Spotify links (clickable)

No CSS or JavaScript is used — only simple and clean HTML to practice webpage structure.

## 💡 What I Learned

- Structuring a webpage using `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Using headings `<h1>`, `<h2>`, horizontal lines `<hr>`
- Inserting images with `<img>`
- Creating clickable links with `<a>`
- Writing neat and organized HTML manually

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – main HTML file
- `images/` – contains all song cover images

## 📌 Note

This project is part of my self-learning journey and built without any external frameworks or design libraries.
